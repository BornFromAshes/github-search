# GithubSearch

## Overview

In this project the goal is to create a website that sends some GET requests to github api and get some info from the requested user. The gathered infrormation includes their name, website, current location, bio and favourite language. To get a user's current favourite language I got the last 5 repositories that they worked on and the most used language is set as their favourite language.

## See for yourself!

The webpage is currenty available at https://bornfromashes.github.io/githubsearch/

All you have to do is type in the username of a github user and you'll more info about them!

## Known Issues

There aren't currently any issues so far so if you find any please create an issue on this repository.
also this was my first time working with HTML, CSS and JS so the way that I wrote the program might not be the best way possible (probably isn't) so if you can improve this project in any regards I will appreciate that aswell.
